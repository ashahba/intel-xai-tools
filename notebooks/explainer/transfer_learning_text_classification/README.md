# Explaining Fine Tuned Text Classifier with PyTorch

This notebook demonstrates fine tuning [pretrained models from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models)
using text classification datasets from the [Hugging Face Datasets catalog](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or
a custom dataset. The [IMDb Larget Movie Review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) is used
from the Hugging Face Datasets catalog, and the [SMS Spam Collection dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection)
is used as an example of a custom dataset being loaded from a csv file.

The notebook uses
[Intel® Extension for PyTorch*](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) which extends PyTorch
with optimizations for extra performance boost on Intel hardware.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies and setup parameters
2. Prepare the dataset
3. Prepare the Model for Fine Tuning and Evaluation
4. Export the model
5. Reload the model and make predictions
6. Get Explainations with Intel Explainable AI Tools

## Running the notebook


To run `PyTorch_Text_Classifier_fine_tuning_with_Attributions.ipynb`, install the following dependencies:
1. [Intel® Explainable AI](https://github.com/Intel/intel-xai-tools)
2. `pip install intel-transfer-learning-tool==0.6`
