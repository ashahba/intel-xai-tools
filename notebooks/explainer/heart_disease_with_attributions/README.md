# Explaining a Custom NN Heart Disease Classification Using the Attributions Explainer 
This notebook demonstrates how to use the attributions explainer API to explain a Cleveland Heart Disease dataset  classification example using a Custom TensorFlow NN. 

`heart_disease.ipynb` performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies
2. Load and process the Heart Disease CSV file from the TensorFlow data hub
3. Design the TensorFlow NN
4. Train the CNN
5. Visualize the custom NN classifications using `kernel_explainer()`

## Running the notebook

To run `heart_disease.ipynb`, install the following dependencies:
1. [IntelÂ® Explainable AI](https://github.com/Intel/intel-xai-tools)
